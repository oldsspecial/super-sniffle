## Active Decisions

### API Design
- **RelationshipPattern Type Constraint**:
  - Enforce single relationship type instead of multiple types
  - Update API functions to match new interface
  - Ensure Cypher compliance
- **Path API Improvements**:
  - Automatically insert implicit relationships between consecutive nodes
  - Skip duplicate nodes during path concatenation
  - Maintain immutable pattern throughout
- **Label Expression System**:
  - Implemented complex label expressions using &, |, and ! operators
  - Added L() helper function for cleaner syntax
- **Quantified Path Patterns**:
  - Added quantifiers like *, +, and {min,max} for variable-length paths
  - Implemented one_or_more() and zero_or_more() convenience methods
- **Variable Naming**:
  - Consistent use of variable names for nodes (p, n) and relationships (r)
  - Clear distinction between variables and properties
- Functional approach with immutable objects
- Method chaining for query construction
- **Operator-based syntax for WHERE clauses** - Using Python operator overloading for intuitive condition building
- **Inline pattern conditions** - Support for Cypher's native inline WHERE syntax: `(p:Person WHERE p.age > 20)`
- **Clear semantic distinction**: `prop()` for properties vs `var()` for variables
- Dual API support - both method-based and operator-based approaches
- Clear separation between components and string generation
- Type hints throughout for IDE support

### Implementation Strategy
- Start with core AST components
- Implement basic query clauses (MATCH, WHERE, RETURN, WITH)
- Add string generation capabilities
- Expand to more complex Cypher features
- Test-driven development with comprehensive coverage

### Development Workflow
- Test-driven development approach
- Documentation-first for public APIs
- Regular refactoring to maintain clean architecture
- Update memory bank after significant changes

## Project Insights

### Key Challenges Solved
1. **Path Construction** - Automated implicit relationship insertion between consecutive nodes
2. **Path Concatenation** - Fixed duplicate node issue during path combination
3. **Variable vs Property distinction** - Implemented semantic separation between variables and properties
4. **WITH clause flexibility** - String-based projections provide maximum Cypher compatibility
5. **Operator overloading** - Full expression system with Python operator support
6. **Clause chaining** - Complex query construction with proper ordering

### Recent Technical Insights
- Paths with consecutive nodes require implicit relationships for valid Cypher syntax
- Path concatenation must detect and handle duplicate nodes at connection points
- Clear semantic APIs prevent common mistakes (prop vs var usage)
- Comprehensive unit tests are crucial for maintaining complex pattern logic
- Immutable patterns simplify reasoning about query composition

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Components
- âœ… **Path API**: Automatic implicit relationships, fixed concatenation logic
- âœ… **Expression System**: Property, Variable, Parameter, Literal classes with full operator support
- âœ… **Pattern System**: 
  - NodePattern with label expressions and inline conditions
  - RelationshipPattern with direction and type constraints
  - PathPattern with automatic relationship insertion
  - QuantifiedPathPattern for variable-length paths
- âœ… **MATCH Clause**: Full implementation with pattern support and chaining
- âœ… **WHERE Clause**: Complex condition building with operator overloading
- âœ… **RETURN Clause**: Projections, DISTINCT, and return-all (*) support
- âœ… **WITH Clause**: String-based projections, DISTINCT, and chaining support
- âœ… **API Functions**: 
  - match(), node(), relationship(), path(), prop(), var(), param(), literal()
  - L() helper for label expressions
  - Quantifier methods: one_or_more(), zero_or_more()

### Test Coverage

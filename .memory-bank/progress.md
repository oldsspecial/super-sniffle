## Current Status: LIMIT and SKIP Clauses Completed! ðŸŽ‰

**Major Milestone Achieved**: LIMIT and SKIP clause implementation completes basic Cypher READ functionality with full pagination support

### Recently Completed (This Session)
1. **LIMIT clause implementation** (`src/super_sniffle/clauses/limit.py`)
   - Complete LimitClause for result limiting
   - Support for integer and string parameters
   - Full method chaining with skip(), return_()
   - Integration with all existing clause types
   - Proper chaining support maintaining clause order

2. **SKIP clause implementation** (`src/super_sniffle/clauses/skip.py`)
   - Complete SkipClause for result offsetting
   - Support for integer and string parameters  
   - Full method chaining with limit(), return_()
   - Integration with all existing clause types
   - Proper chaining support maintaining clause order

3. **Enhanced existing clauses with LIMIT/SKIP support**
   - Updated MatchClause with limit() and skip() methods
   - Updated OrderByClause with limit() and skip() methods
   - Removed NotImplementedError placeholders
   - Full integration across the entire clause system

4. **Package and module updates**
   - Added LimitClause and SkipClause to clauses/__init__.py
   - Updated main package __init__.py with new exports
   - Added to __all__ lists for proper public API exposure
   - Full type checking and import handling

5. **Comprehensive testing and validation**
   - Created `test_limit_skip_demo.py` with extensive test scenarios
   - Tests basic LIMIT and SKIP usage
   - Demonstrates pagination patterns (SKIP + LIMIT)
   - Complex query chains: MATCH â†’ WHERE â†’ WITH â†’ ORDER BY â†’ SKIP â†’ LIMIT â†’ RETURN
   - Real-world examples: top N queries, pagination, batch processing
   - All tests passing successfully with proper Cypher generation

6. **Updated existing test files**
   - Enabled LIMIT functionality in `test_order_by_demo.py`
   - Updated "Top 5 most connected people" example to use .limit(5)
   - All existing tests continue to pass

### Previous Achievements
1. **ORDER BY clause implementation** with asc/desc functions
2. **Enhanced WITH clause with tuple projections**
3. **Expression system improvements** with OrderByExpression
4. **API and package updates** for ORDER BY functionality

### What Works Now âœ…
- **Expression System**: Complete operator overloading for WHERE conditions + OrderByExpression
- **Pattern System**: Nodes, relationships, paths with inline WHERE conditions  
- **MATCH Clause**: Single patterns, multiple patterns, chaining, relates_to integration
- **WHERE Clause**: Filtering with proper clause order and complex chaining
- **WITH Clause**: String and tuple projections, DISTINCT support, seamless chaining
- **ORDER BY Clause**: Ascending/descending sorts with asc()/desc() functions, full chaining
- **RETURN Clause**: Projections, DISTINCT, return everything (*), full chaining support
- **Variables System**: var() function for referencing variables in WHERE after WITH
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites pass (test_match_demo.py, test_return_demo.py, test_order_by_demo.py)
- **Examples**: Working demonstrations with complete query chains and real-world scenarios

## What's Next

### Core Components
- âœ… WHERE clause predicates (COMPLETED with operator syntax!)
- âœ… AST dataclasses for nodes and relationships (COMPLETED!)
- âœ… Basic pattern construction (COMPLETED!)
- âœ… **MATCH clause implementation (COMPLETED!)** 
- âœ… **WHERE clause (separate from patterns) (COMPLETED!)** - Filtering after MATCH with complex chaining
- âœ… **WITH clause projections (COMPLETED!)** - String and tuple projections with full chaining support
- âœ… **ORDER BY clause (COMPLETED!)** - Ascending/descending sorts with asc()/desc() functions

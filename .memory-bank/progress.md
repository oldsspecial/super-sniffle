- âœ… Initial package scaffolding (completed)

## Current Status: ORDER BY Clause and Enhanced WITH Implemented! ðŸŽ‰

**Major Milestone Achieved**: ORDER BY clause implementation with asc/desc functions and enhanced WITH clause with tuple projections

### Recently Completed (This Session)
1. **ORDER BY clause implementation** (`src/super_sniffle/clauses/order_by.py`)
   - Complete OrderByClause with ascending/descending sort support  
   - OrderByExpression class for sort field definitions
   - asc() and desc() helper functions for intuitive syntax
   - Integration with all clause types (MATCH, WHERE, WITH, RETURN)
   - Proper chaining support with return_() method

2. **Enhanced WITH clause with tuple projections** (`src/super_sniffle/clauses/with_.py`)
   - Support for tuple-based projections: (expression, alias)
   - Mixed projections: strings and tuples in same clause
   - Improved type annotations with Union[str, Tuple[str, str]]
   - Backwards compatible with existing string projections
   - Full integration with ORDER BY and other clauses

3. **Expression system improvements** (`src/super_sniffle/ast/expressions.py`)
   - OrderByExpression class for sort field definitions
   - Proper Cypher generation with ASC/DESC modifiers
   - Integration with expression type hierarchy

4. **API and package updates**
   - Added asc() and desc() functions to public API
   - Updated package exports in __init__.py files
   - OrderByClause added to clause exports
   - Full type checking and import handling

5. **Comprehensive testing**
   - Created `test_order_by_demo.py` with complete test scenarios
   - Demonstrates ORDER BY with RETURN, WITH, and complex chains
   - Tests tuple projections in WITH clauses
   - Real-world examples: ranking queries, aggregations
   - All tests passing successfully

### What Works Now âœ…
- **Expression System**: Complete operator overloading for WHERE conditions + OrderByExpression
- **Pattern System**: Nodes, relationships, paths with inline WHERE conditions  
- **MATCH Clause**: Single patterns, multiple patterns, chaining, relates_to integration
- **WHERE Clause**: Filtering with proper clause order and complex chaining
- **WITH Clause**: String and tuple projections, DISTINCT support, seamless chaining
- **ORDER BY Clause**: Ascending/descending sorts with asc()/desc() functions, full chaining
- **RETURN Clause**: Projections, DISTINCT, return everything (*), full chaining support
- **Variables System**: var() function for referencing variables in WHERE after WITH
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites pass (test_match_demo.py, test_return_demo.py, test_order_by_demo.py)
- **Examples**: Working demonstrations with complete query chains and real-world scenarios

## What's Next

### Core Components
- âœ… WHERE clause predicates (COMPLETED with operator syntax!)
- âœ… AST dataclasses for nodes and relationships (COMPLETED!)
- âœ… Basic pattern construction (COMPLETED!)
- âœ… **MATCH clause implementation (COMPLETED!)** 
- âœ… **WHERE clause (separate from patterns) (COMPLETED!)** - Filtering after MATCH with complex chaining
- âœ… **WITH clause projections (COMPLETED!)** - String and tuple projections with full chaining support
- âœ… **ORDER BY clause (COMPLETED!)** - Ascending/descending sorts with asc()/desc() functions
- âœ… **RETURN clause projections (COMPLETED!)** - Full support including DISTINCT and return everything (*)
- â¬œ LIMIT/SKIP clauses for pagination

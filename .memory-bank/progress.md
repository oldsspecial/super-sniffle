## Evolution of Decisions

### Path API Design
- Initial implementation required explicit relationships
- Updated to automatically insert implicit relationships between consecutive nodes
- Improved concatenation to handle duplicate nodes

### Subquery Architecture
- Started with basic CALL subquery
- Added comprehensive variable scoping support
- Implemented proper string formatting and indentation

## Lessons Learned
- Automated relationship insertion significantly improves API usability
- Comprehensive test coverage is essential for maintaining complex pattern logic
- Memory bank documentation is crucial for context preservation between sessions
- **CALL subquery implementation** required careful handling of variable scoping patterns

## Success Stories
- ✅ Successfully implemented and tested CALL subquery clause (18 tests)
- ✅ Fixed complex path concatenation issue
- ✅ Maintained 100% test pass rate through changes
- ✅ **192/192 unit tests passing** with 92% coverage
- ✅ **CALL subquery and UNWIND both fully implemented and tested**

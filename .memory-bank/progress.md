# Progress: super-sniffle

## Project Status
**Current Phase**: SUBQUERY Implemented - Ready for CALL IN TRANSACTIONS

**Overall Progress**: 50%

**Last Updated**: July 22, 2025

## What Works

### Codebase Refactoring
- ✅ Split patterns.py into maintainable modules (one class per file)
- ✅ Split expressions.py into maintainable modules (one class per file)
- ✅ Maintained 100% test coverage after refactoring

### Aggregation Functions
- ✅ Implemented FunctionExpression class
- ✅ Added count(), sum(), avg(), min(), max() functions
- ✅ Added support for DISTINCT and aliasing
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

### OPTIONAL MATCH
- ✅ Implemented AST class, API method, string generation, and comprehensive tests

### Path Operator Overloading
- ✅ Added `__add__` operator to NodePattern, RelationshipPattern, and PathPattern
- ✅ Enhanced path() function to accept mixed pattern types
- ✅ Implemented WHERE condition chaining for paths
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for operator functionality

### RelationshipPattern Type Constraint
- ✅ Enforced single relationship type per Cypher specification
- ✅ Updated API functions to match new interface
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for relationship patterns

### Path API Improvements
- ✅ Automatic insertion of implicit relationships ("--") between consecutive nodes
- ✅ Fixed path concatenation to handle duplicate nodes
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for path operations

### Documentation
- ✅ Memory bank structure established
- ✅ Project brief defined
- ✅ Product context documented
- ✅ System architecture outlined
- ✅ Technical context established
- ✅ Active context updated with recent changes

### Infrastructure
- ✅ GitHub repository created
- ✅ Basic .gitignore in place

- ✅ README.md with project overview
- ✅ MIT License file
- ✅ Sphinx documentation configuration
- ✅ Basic usage examples
- ✅ Test directory structure

### Expression System
- ✅ Complete expression class hierarchy
- ✅ Operator overloading for intuitive syntax
- ✅ Property, Parameter, and Literal classes
- ✅ Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) with & | ~ operators
- ✅ Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
- ✅ Method-based operations (contains, starts_with, ends_with, etc.)
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ Working demo and examples

### Pattern System
- ✅ NodePattern class with label expressions and inline WHERE support
- ✅ RelationshipPattern class with inline WHERE support
- ✅ PathPattern class for complex traversals with automatic relationship insertion
- ✅ QuantifiedPathPattern for variable-length paths with quantifiers
- ✅ Support for Cypher's native inline syntax: (p:Person WHERE p.age > 20)
- ✅ API functions: node(), relationship(), path(), L() for label expressions
- ✅ Integration with operator-based expressions
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for all patterns
- ✅ Real-world scenario examples and demos

### CALL Subquery
- ✅ Implemented CALL subquery clause with variable scoping
- ✅ Support for CALL { ... }, CALL(var) { ... }, CALL(*) { ... }
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Proper integration with other clauses
- ✅ Fixed string literal formatting to use single quotes

## What's In Progress
(No active development items at the moment)

## Current Status: SUBQUERY Implemented! ✅

**Recent Achievements**:
1. Implemented CALL subquery clause with comprehensive tests
2. Fixed string literal formatting to use single quotes
3. Updated tests to match correct syntax
4. Verified all unit tests pass (including new CALL subquery tests)
5. Updated memory bank documentation

### What Works Now ✅
- **Expression System**: Complete operator overloading for WHERE conditions
- **Pattern System**: Nodes, relationships, paths with inline WHERE conditions  
- **RelationshipPattern**: Enforced single relationship type per Cypher specification
- **Path Construction**: Automatic handling of consecutive nodes
- **Path Concatenation**: Correct handling of duplicate nodes
- **MATCH Clause**: Single patterns, multiple patterns, chaining
- **OPTIONAL MATCH**: Left join equivalent for graph queries
- **WHERE Clause**: Filtering with proper clause order and complex chaining
- **WITH Clause**: String and tuple projections, DISTINCT support
- **RETURN Clause**: Projections, DISTINCT, return everything (*)
- **ORDER BY Clause**: Ascending/descending sorts
- **LIMIT/SKIP**: Pagination support
- **UNION/UNION ALL**: Compound query support
- **CALL Subquery**: Modern subquery syntax with variable scoping
- **Test Coverage**: 100% pass rate on unit tests

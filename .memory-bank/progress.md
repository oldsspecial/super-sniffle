- âœ… Comprehensive unit tests
- âœ… Working demo and examples

### Pattern System with Inline Conditions (NEW!)
- âœ… NodePattern class with inline WHERE support

- âœ… Support for Cypher's native inline syntax: (p:Person WHERE p.age > 20)
- âœ… API functions: node(), relationship(), path()
- âœ… Integration with operator-based expressions
- âœ… Comprehensive unit tests for all patterns
- âœ… Real-world scenario examples and demos

## What's In Progress

### Project Setup
- âœ… Basic project structure (completed)
- ðŸ”„ Development environment configuration
- âœ… Initial package scaffolding (completed)

## Current Status: RETURN Clause Complete! ðŸŽ‰

**Major Milestone Achieved**: Full RETURN clause implementation with comprehensive chaining support

### Recently Completed (This Session)
1. **Complete RETURN clause implementation** (`src/super_sniffle/clauses/return_.py`)
   - Support for specific projections and "return everything" (*) functionality
   - Full DISTINCT support for both projections and "*"
   - Seamless integration with MATCH and WHERE clauses
   - Proper Cypher generation with correct clause ordering

2. **Enhanced clause chaining system**
   - Fixed complex clause ordering issues (MATCH â†’ WHERE â†’ RETURN)
   - Added preceding_clause support to WHERE clause
   - Implemented `_render_preceding_clauses()` for complex clause chains
   - Support for multiple MATCH clauses with proper ordering

3. **Updated exports and module structure**
   - Added `ReturnClause` to package exports
   - Updated both `MatchClause.return_()` and `WhereClause.return_()` methods
   - Proper import handling to avoid circular dependencies

4. **Comprehensive testing**
   - Created `test_return_demo.py` with 7 complete test scenarios
   - All tests passing including complex real-world examples
   - Covers return everything, DISTINCT, clause chaining, multiple MATCH clauses

### What Works Now âœ…
- **Expression System**: Complete operator overloading for WHERE conditions
- **Pattern System**: Nodes, relationships, paths with inline WHERE conditions  
- **MATCH Clause**: Single patterns, multiple patterns, chaining, relates_to integration
- **WHERE Clause**: Filtering with proper clause order and complex chaining
- **RETURN Clause**: Projections, DISTINCT, return everything (*), full chaining support
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites pass (test_match_demo.py, test_return_demo.py)
- **Examples**: Working demonstrations with complete query chains

## What's Next

### Core Components
- âœ… WHERE clause predicates (COMPLETED with operator syntax!)
- âœ… AST dataclasses for nodes and relationships (COMPLETED!)
- âœ… Basic pattern construction (COMPLETED!)
- âœ… **MATCH clause implementation (COMPLETED!)** 
- âœ… **WHERE clause (separate from patterns) (COMPLETED!)** - Filtering after MATCH with complex chaining
- âœ… **RETURN clause projections (COMPLETED!)** - Full support including DISTINCT and return everything (*)
- â¬œ ORDER BY clause for result ordering
- â¬œ LIMIT/SKIP clauses for pagination

### Development Infrastructure
- â¬œ Poetry configuration
- â¬œ Testing framework setup
- â¬œ Linting and formatting configuration
- â¬œ CI/CD pipeline

### Documentation
- â¬œ README with basic usage examples
- â¬œ API documentation structure

# super-sniffle

A Python library for generating Neo4j Cypher queries in a functional and flexible way.

## Overview

super-sniffle provides a clean, type-safe, and maintainable way to generate complex Neo4j Cypher READ queries programmatically, eliminating the need for error-prone string concatenation.

## Features

- **Functional API**: Build queries using composable functions and method chaining
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints for excellent IDE support
- **CYPHER25 Compliance**: Strict adherence to the CYPHER25 specification
- **Immutable Objects**: Safe composition without side effects
- **Well-Formatted Output**: Generates readable, properly indented Cypher queries
- **Zero Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies for easy installation

## Installation

```bash
pip install super-sniffle
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oldsspecial/super-sniffle.git
cd super-sniffle
poetry install
```

## Quick Start

> **Note**: super-sniffle is currently in early development. The API shown below represents the planned interface and is not yet implemented.

```python
from super_sniffle import match, node, relationship, prop, param

# Build a simple query
query = (
    match(node("p", "Person"))
    .where(prop("p", "age").gt(param("min_age")))
    .return_("p.name", "p.age")
    .order_by("p.age")
    .limit(10)
    .to_cypher()
)

print(query)
# Output:
# MATCH (p:Person)
# WHERE p.age > $min_age
# RETURN p.name, p.age
# ORDER BY p.age
# LIMIT 10
```

### Complex Patterns

```python
# Build queries with relationships
query = (
    match(
        node("p", "Person")
        .relates_to(">", "KNOWS", node("f", "Person"))
        .relates_to(">", "LIVES_IN", node("c", "City"))
    )
    .where(
        prop("p", "age").between(25, 40)
        .and_(prop("c", "name").equals(param("city_name")))
    )
    .return_("p.name", "f.name", "c.name")
    .to_cypher()
)
```

## Why super-sniffle?

### Before (String Concatenation)
```python
# Error-prone and hard to maintain
def build_person_query(min_age, city_name):
    return f"""
    MATCH (p:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(f:Person)-[:LIVES_IN]->(c:City)
    WHERE p.age > {min_age} AND c.name = '{city_name}'
    RETURN p.name, f.name, c.name
    """
```

### After (super-sniffle)
```python
# Type-safe and composable
def build_person_query():
    return (
        match(
            node("p", "Person")
            .relates_to(">", "KNOWS", node("f", "Person"))
            .relates_to(">", "LIVES_IN", node("c", "City"))
        )
        .where(
            prop("p", "age").gt(param("min_age"))
            .and_(prop("c", "name").equals(param("city_name")))
        )
        .return_("p.name", "f.name", "c.name")
    )
```

## Development Status

super-sniffle is currently in the initial planning and development phase. The project structure and architecture have been established, and we're working on implementing the core components.

### Current Progress
- âœ… Project structure and configuration
- âœ… Architecture design and documentation
- ðŸ”„ Core AST components (in progress)
- â¬œ Basic query clauses (MATCH, WHERE, RETURN)
- â¬œ String generation
- â¬œ Advanced Cypher features
- â¬œ Documentation and examples

## Scope

### Supported Features (Planned)
- READ queries only (MATCH, WHERE, RETURN, etc.)
- All major Cypher READ operations and patterns
- Complex patterns including quantified path patterns
- CALL() clauses for procedures
- APOC function calls (read-only subset)
- Query composition and optimization

### Not Supported
- Query execution (use Neo4j drivers for that)
- Write operations (CREATE, MERGE, DELETE, etc.)
- Administrative commands
- Database management features

Here’s a refined breakdown of each URL, formatted as clear instructions for an AI coding agent. Each section includes what the feature does, how to use it, and a concise Cypher example.

---

## 1. **CALL subquery** (`CALL { … }`)

* **What it is**: A subquery block that runs once per incoming row. Variables returned inside are scoped outward ⟶ can change row counts.
* **Why use**: Modularize logic, execute side-effects, manage memory per row.
* **Key rules**:

  * Must include `RETURN` (if you want a result).
  * Use `CALL()` with explicit scope: `CALL(p, t)` or `CALL(*)` or `CALL()`.
  * Returning vs Unit subqueries: returning affects row count; unit is for side-effects only.
* **Example**:

  ```cypher
  MATCH (t:Team)
  CALL(t) {
    MATCH (p:Player)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(t)
    RETURN collect(p) AS players
  }
  RETURN t, players
  ```
* **Performance tip**: Prevents full graph accumulation by batching per row ([Graph Database & Analytics][1], [Graph Database & Analytics][2], [Graph Database & Analytics][3])

---

## 2. **CALL subqueries in transactions** (`CALL { … } IN TRANSACTIONS`)

* **What it does**: Splits heavy write workloads into auto‑batched inner transactions (default batch = 1000), controlled by an enclosing implicit transaction.
* **Why use**: Avoids memory issues on big imports/updates/deletes; commits in chunks.
* **Requirements**:

  * Only works in implicit transactions.
  * In Neo4j Browser, prefix with `:auto`.
* **Example**:

  ```cypher
  :auto
  MATCH (n:Node)
  CALL(n) IN TRANSACTIONS {
    // heavy update on n
    SET n.processed = true
  }
  ```
* **Batch size**: default 1000 rows per inner transaction ([Graph Database & Analytics][4])

---

## 3. **COLLECT subqueries**

* **What it does**: Inline subquery that returns a single-column list via `COLLECT { … }`.
* **Why use**: Aggregate related data per row without manual `UNWIND` or `WITH`.
* **Key rules**:

  * Only non-writing operations allowed.
  * Must end with `RETURN` returning one column.
  * Implicit access to outer variables.
* **Example**:

  ```cypher
  MATCH (p:Person)
  WHERE 'Ozzy' IN COLLECT {
    MATCH (p)-[:HAS_DOG]->(d:Dog)
    RETURN d.name
  }
  RETURN p.name
  ```
* **Introduced**: In Neo4j 5.6 ([Graph Database & Analytics][2], [Graph Database & Analytics][1], [Graph Database & Analytics][5], [Graph Database & Analytics][6])

---

## 4. **COUNT subqueries**

* **What it does**: Counts rows returned by an inline subquery via `COUNT { … }`.
* **Why use**: Embed pattern counts in `WHERE`, `RETURN`, `SET`, `CASE`, etc.
* **Key rules**:

  * Non-writing only.
  * `RETURN` inside subquery is optional.
  * Can include `WHERE`, `UNION`, `WITH`.
  * Outer variables accessible, inner ones not.
* **Examples**:

  ```cypher
  MATCH (p:Person)
  WHERE COUNT { (p)-[:HAS_DOG]->() } > 1
  RETURN p.name
  ```

  ```cypher
  MATCH (p:Person)
  RETURN p.name,
    COUNT { (p)-[:HAS_DOG]->(:Dog) } AS numDogs
  ```
* **Flexible use**: Works inside `SET`, `CASE`, grouping, etc. ([Graph Database & Analytics][7], [Graph Database & Analytics][8], [Stack Overflow][9])

---

## 5. **EXISTS (existential) subqueries**

* **What it does**: Returns `true` if the subquery pattern matches at least once; stops at first match.
* **Why use**: Filter based on existence of patterns more powerful than simple path expressions.
* **Key rules**:

  * Pattern or full `MATCH…WHERE` inside `EXISTS { … }`.
  * Outer variables accessible within.
  * Short-circuits on first match for efficiency.
* **Examples**:

  ```cypher
  MATCH (p:Person)
  WHERE EXISTS {
    MATCH (p)-[:HAS_DOG]->(:Dog)
  }
  RETURN p.name
  ```

  ````cypher
  MATCH (p:Person)
  WHERE EXISTS {
    MATCH (p)-[:HAS_DOG]->(d:Dog)
    WHERE p.name = d.name
  }
  RETURN p.name
  ``` :contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}
  ````

### Implementation Tips for AI Agent

1. Choose subquery type based on intent: `CALL` for side-effects/complex queries; `COLLECT`/`COUNT`/`EXISTS` for inline expressions.
2. Respect scoping rules: import/capture variables correctly.
3. Use `IN TRANSACTIONS` for heavy write operations.
4. Prefer existential subqueries when only existence matters—performance-friendly due to early exit.
5. Nest or combine subqueries logically with `WITH`, `CASE`, `SET`, etc., while minding scoping.

You're right to think there's been **evolution in Cypher syntax**, especially with **Neo4j 5.x and later** — and yes, **there is a newer syntax for boolean logic over labels** using bitwise-style operators like `&` and `|`. However, it’s still limited and a bit nuanced.

---

### ✅ Neo4j 5+ (with GDS-style boolean label expressions)

You can now do:

```cypher
MATCH (n:Person & Employee)
RETURN n
```

This is shorthand for:

```cypher
MATCH (n)
WHERE n:Person AND n:Employee
RETURN n
```

---

### Here's how it works:

| Expression              | Meaning                             |                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `(n:Person & Employee)` | Node `n` has **both** labels        |                               |
| \`(n:Person \| Employee)\`                         | Node `n` has **either** label |
| `!(n:Employee)`         | Node `n` **does not have** Employee |                               |

---

### ✅ Full example:

```cypher
MATCH (n:Person & Employee | Manager)
RETURN n
```

This would return nodes that:

* Have **both** `Person` and `Employee`, **or**
* Have the `Manager` label.

---

### ❗ Important Notes

* This is **not standard Cypher**, but rather **Neo4j's extended Cypher**, supported in Neo4j **5.3+** and later.
* It works only in **label-position** inside `MATCH`, like `MATCH (n:...)`. You can't do this in the `WHERE` clause.

---

### ✅ Negation example:

```cypher
MATCH (n:!Employee)
RETURN n
```

Matches all nodes **without** the `Employee` label.

### Final Summary

| Syntax                | Meaning                        |                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `(n:LabelA & LabelB)` | Node has **both** labels       |                           |
| \`(n\:LabelA          \| LabelB)\`                      | Node has **either** label |
| `(n:!LabelA)`         | Node **does not** have label A |                           |

This newer syntax makes label logic more concise — great for readability.
